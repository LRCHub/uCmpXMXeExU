In the middle of a crowded room
I'm sitting i'm all alone
And i am looking at what i see
In the middle of an empty screen
(Chorus)
Tv
Anything is good enough for me
Anything is good enough
As the camera looks in his face
Eyes are staring in another place
And i'm looking at what i see
Nothing perfect on tv
(Repeat chorus)
Anything is good enough, yeah
Anything is good enough
Enough
Enough
As the camera looks into my eyes
You can tell i'm telling lies
(Repeat chorus)
Good enough for me
