Hey, your glass is empty
It's a hell of a way home
Why don't you let me take you?
I never would have opened up
But you seemed so real to me
After all the bullshit I've heard
It's refreshing not to see
I don't have to pretend
She doesn't expect it from me
So don't tell me I haven't been good to you
Don't tell me I have never been there for you
Don't tell me why nothing is good enough
Hey little girl, would you like some candy?
Your mama said that it's okay
The door is open, come on outside
No, I can't come out today
It's not the wind that cracked your shoulder
And threw you to the ground
Who's there that makes you so afraid?
You're shaken to the bone
And I don't understand
You deserve so much more than this
So don't tell me why he's never been good to you
Don't tell me why he's never been there for you
And don't you know that why is simply not good enough
Oh, so just let me try and I will be good to you
Just let me try and I will be there for you
I'll show you why you're so much more than good enough
So don't tell me why he's never been good to you

Don't tell me why he's never been there for you
And don't you know that why is simply not good enough
Oh, so just let me try and I will be good to you

Just let me try and I will be there for you
I'll show you why you're so much more than good enough
