If it's good enough for Granddad
It's good enough for me
The way it was that's the way it's got to be.

He told me all about the good times that he had
Even when the times were sad
What's good enough for Granddad.

He's been to all kinds of places
Been to every old foreign land
Ain't a man alive [who can] shuck and jive
Better than Granddad can!

All the good times that he had
If they were good enough for Granddad,
They're good enough for me!

He's been to all kinds of places
Been to every old foreign land
Ain't a man alive [who can] shuck and jive
Better than Granddad can, uh oh!

He told me all about the good times that he had
Even when the times were sad
What's good enough for Granddad.

Yes, yes...

All the good times that he had
If they were good enough for Granddad,
They're good enough for me!

Yeah, yeah...

(Excellent!)
